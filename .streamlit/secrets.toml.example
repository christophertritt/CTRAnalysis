# Streamlit Secrets Template
# Copy this file to secrets.toml and add your actual secrets
# secrets.toml is already in .gitignore to prevent accidental commits

# Example: Database connection (if needed)
# [database]
# host = "localhost"
# port = 5432
# database = "ctr_data"
# username = "your_username"
# password = "your_password"

# Example: API keys (if needed)
# [api]
# google_maps_key = "your_api_key_here"
# analytics_key = "your_analytics_key"

# Note: The current dashboard reads from a local CSV file
# so no secrets are required for basic operation.
